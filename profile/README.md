# Welcome to Caniventure Development!

We're a team (of one person right now) working on Caniventure.

## Who are our team members?

Our team consists of:

- **[Yoshiboi18303](https://github.com/Yoshiboi18303)**

## What do we do?

Currently our only focus is on the development of Caniventure, we may have more stuff to share in the future. Caniventures' repository will be here as soon as possible _(as soon as the bot is in a usable state)_.

## Can I help?

At the moment, **yes**! We do accept contributions and extra team members, all you'll need is knowledge of TypeScript and Discord.js _(and eventually Rust)_. It's also recommended to use VS Code for development. Although we can work around that, probably.
